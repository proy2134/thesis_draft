% We present a method for efficiently enumerating combinatorially distinct world models and computing the most likely model from one or more views. These are incorporated into single and multi-step planners. We evaluate these planners in simulation as well as with experiments on a real robot.

%Deep learning solutions are general and can be applied to a wide range of problem domains. However, these solutions require a huge amount of training data and obtaining such data for many problems (e.g. fruit detection) is difficult. Synthetic data can alleviate the painstaking problem of data annotation. As we design the models ourselves, the labeling comes for free.

 %A network trained only on synthetic data though does not generally perform well on real data. Synthetic data can differ from real data on two different levels. First, it is extremely time consuming and nearly impossible to design synthetic data that looks identical to the real data. This is known as the image level difference. Second, modern deep convolutional networks learn their feature descriptors from data. As a result, at the feature level, synthetic and real data can differ significantly. This is known as the feature level difference. In technical terms, these two difference together is defined as the domain gap. 
 
 %As the final contribution in this dissertation, we present a deep learning framework to reduce this domain gap between synthetic and real data.
 
 %Regular yield monitoring is crucial as it will not only enable farmers to understand what is going on the field currently but also predict what is likely to happen days or even weeks ahead. This will be the biggest game-changer as the farmers will be able to plan for the future in an informed manner.
 
 
 %Tree crop yield mapping involves solving multiple computer vision problems (fruit detection,  counting, recovering underlying 3D geometry for tracking fruit across different frames in continuously changing illumination) as well as planning problems (path planning for covering all fruit, picking fruit).
